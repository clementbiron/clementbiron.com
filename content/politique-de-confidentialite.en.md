# Privacy Policy

## Cookies and opt-out

When you visit this website, we leave a small text file (a "cookie") on your computer. This allows us to measure the number of visits we have had and which pages are viewed most frequently.

### This website does not display a cookie consent banner. Why not?

That's right, you don't have to click on a block that covers half the page to say that you agree to the deposit of cookies - even if you don't know what that means!

We're simply complying with the law, which states that certain audience tracking tools, properly configured to respect privacy, are exempt from prior authorisation.
